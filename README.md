# SSGESA

For nearly a decade, the difficulties in determining and reproducing Ras-dependency indexes (RDIs) have limited their use and further delineation of the biology underlying Ras dependency. We describe the use of a computational single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method to derive RDIs from gene expression data in this report.
